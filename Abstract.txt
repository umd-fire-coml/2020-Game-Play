This project aims to apply reinforcement learning to teach an "agent" how to play a classic game in "Street Fighter 2".
We use the Street Fighter 2 Champions Deluxe Edition in this project. 

Reinforcement Learning
    Reinforcement Learning (RL) describes a field of machine learning wherein a function or model is dynamically "learns" through an action-reward 
    feedback loop, choosing actions that maximize the reward.

Packages Used
1. Dopamine Framework
    Deep Q-networks (DQN) to model our agent/player
    Retro emulation in which we can play thousands of games.
    Drawback: Version used is only compatible with Tensorflow 1.15.1 and prior
    Provides methods to train and test reinforcement learning models
2. Gym Retro
    Environment emulator used to visualize and simulate the game between our agent and either us or the CPU.
3. Matplotlib
    A fast and universal way to visualize our training data
4. Gin
    Gin helps set up configuration files
    Interacts with Dopamine. Requires very basic parameters to run. """
